# Bangalore-House-Price-Prediction
This project is about a house price prediction model using machine learning. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data)
has been obtained from Kaggle. It demonstrates the use of machine learning in the prediction of house prices by taking certain parameters such as location, number of bedrooms, etc. as inputs and predicts the price. The references has been taken from [Codebasics channel in YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3ut2o1ay5Dqh-r1kq6ZU8W0M).

A good estimate of the price is necessary because often the buyers and sellers too are confused about setting a proper price for a house. This might lead generally the price being too high or low than the buyer had estimated. So, to solve this problem machine learning can provide a prediction of the house price using data of the prices.
The model here uses Linear Regression to predict the prices.

**Future Scope**: The model could be utilised by people to predict the price and thereby helping in decision making in terms of both cost and time.

**Area of Improvement**: The model could be modified using more data and observing the patterns in it. Also, selection of proper features could improve the performance of the model.
